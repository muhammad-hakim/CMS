                This site describes the terms and conditions to be adhered when designing user interfaces, single login, and subdomain names under Oga.Fasah.sa
                The work teams of ministries, agencies and governmental entities use this site as a basic guide in the process of adapting their services with the identity and standards of Fasah program, to appear as a unified station for all services of starting, practicing, and ending a business in the Kingdom.

Many popular companies (such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) use this mechanism to give users access to a set of account data of their registered people.

                    In order to start connecting the service with your Single Window system, you should get the following by contacting the project manager:

                    <h3>Domain names</h3>
                    <p>Fasah provides a set of guidelines and procedures to be followed during the deployment of a government service under Fasah sub-domain names. This site provides the conditions and procedures to be followed to reserve a subdomain within a clearing platform.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Domain Name Standards</h3>
                    <p>The sub-point names for the services that will be provided within Fasah platform are created by applying for Fasah manager.<br>
                    Naming the domains and subdomains should be by using the most customized and then the more general domain; this is to distinguish Fasah services and systems from the ones provided by external parties.<br>
                    Fasah subdomain names are subject to a set of naming conditions, as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="fancyUl">
                        <li>Only English letters (CAPITAL and small case) and English numbers are accepted</li>
                        <li>The negative (-) symbol is accepted in the subdomain name, however, not in the beginning of the name</li>
                        <li>The minimum subdomain name is 3 characters and the maximum limit is 15 characters</li>
                        <li>You should avoid any special symbols in the domain name such as:  \ / : * ؟ " <> | , ! @ # $ % ^ & . () {} []</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Terms of Reserving a Subdomain</h3>
                    <ul class="fancyUl">
                        <li>The name should reflect the name of the government agency or service name you provide</li>
                        <li>It should not have been pre-reserved within a Fasah platform, to ensure that the names are unique</li>
                        <li>The name is not a reserved for Fasah services and applications</li>
                        <li>The service provided is supported by the Https encrypted data transfer protocol</li>

                    <li>Adding Fasah logo in the header of the service page to be linked</li>
                    <li>Removing any links from the page that are not related to service</li>
                    <li>Adding Fasah header and footer to the service page</li>
                    <li>Applying and using Fasah identity color palette as detailed in the identity portal only</li>
                    <li>Using the elements of the design as detailed in the identity portal, such as: Buttons, model elements, icons library, and alert boxes</li>
                    <li>Applying the official font of Fasah identity</li>
                    <li>Adding a statement indicating the name of the organization that offers the service (e.g. this service is managed by the Ministry of Trade and Investment).</li>
